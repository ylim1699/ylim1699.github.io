            I'm currently still deciding on what to major and
            Something that I really enjoyd doing is watching mma and boxing. </p>
            <p>My favorite thing about BYU-Idaho is the tuition cost and I'm planning on pursuing at least bachelors on whatever
            I decide to major.</p>
            <p>I'm just taking this class because I like to learn and having the skill
            to make my own website might be useful in whatever I do in the future because everyone uses the
            the internet. I've been a member of the Church for my whole life and my favorite scriptures are:
            2 corinthians 4:15-18.</p>
